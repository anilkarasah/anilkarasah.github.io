<!DOCTYPE html><p>Nonogram Puzzle is a very old Japan puzzle game. It shows the adjacent blocks every row and column and you have to use these informations to solve the puzzle. I used C language to create this puzzle game which you play on terminal screen. Visit <a href="https://github.com/anilkarasah/Nonogram"><em>Nonogram on Github</em></a>.</p>
