<p><a href="https://nerdlegame.com/" title="Official Nerdle Game Website"><em>Nerdle Game</em></a> is a puzzle game and a different approach of Wordle. It generates a random basic mathematical equation and you have 6 chances to find the correct equation. I wrote this game in Java with GUI for my <em>Object-Oriented Programming</em> lecture.
