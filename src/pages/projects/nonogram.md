Nonogram Puzzle is a very old Japan puzzle game. It shows the adjacent blocks every row and column and you have to use these informations to solve the puzzle. I used C language to create this puzzle game which you play on terminal screen. Visit [_Nonogram on Github_](https://github.com/anilkarasah/Nonogram).
