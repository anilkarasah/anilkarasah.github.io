This is an API of a Wallet app which you can control your budget with what you have spent the most until now. It was for my _System Analysis and Design_ lecture.
You can view the documentation of the API through [**_Postman Documentation of EMS_**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19777122/UyxjEkai). Visit [_Expense Management System on Github_](https://github.com/anilkarasah/ExpenseManagementSystem).
