  Nerdle Game <i class="fa-solid fa-up-right-from-square">
  </i></a> is a puzzle game and a different approach of 
  Wordle. It generates a random basic mathematical equation
  and you have 6 chances to find the correct equation.
  I wrote this game in Java with GUI for my <i>Object-Oriented
  Programming</i> lecture.
