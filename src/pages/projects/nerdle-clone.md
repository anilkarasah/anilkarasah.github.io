[_Nerdle Game_](https://nerdlegame.com/ 'Official Nerdle Game Website') is a puzzle game and a different approach of Wordle. It generates a random basic mathematical equation and you have 6 chances to find the correct equation. I wrote this game in Java with GUI for my _Object-Oriented Programming_ lecture. Visit [_Nerdle Clone on Github_](https://github.com/anilkarasah/NerdleClone).
