[Bug Tracker System](https://bugtrackersystem.anilkarasah.me 'You can visit Bug Tracker System with this link') is a
tool for helping businesses keep track of bugs of their projects. I have created a RESTful API using .NET Core 6,
database with PostgreSQL and front-end application with Angular. You can visit
[Bug Tracker System on Github](https://github.com/anilkarasah/BugTrackerSystem 'Github Repository of Bug Tracker System').
