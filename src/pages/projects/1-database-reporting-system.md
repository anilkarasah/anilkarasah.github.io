Database Reporting System (DRS), is a Text-to-SQL tool to simplify database querying. It supports multiple large
language models (e.g. GPT, Grok, Mistral, Llama) and prompting strategies, like in-context learning. We have developed
a test pipeline to benchmark each LLM and strategy fairly. This application improved execution accuracies of generated
SQL queries by 13%.
