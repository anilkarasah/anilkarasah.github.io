Bug Tracker System is a tool for helping businesses keep track of bugs of their projects. I have created a RESTful API using .NET Core 6, database with PostgreSQL and front-end application with Angular. You can visit Bug Tracker System [**_on Github_**](https://github.com/anilkarasah/BugTrackerSystem 'Github Repository of Bug Tracker System'). (currently not fully operating though)
